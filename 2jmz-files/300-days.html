And it will be a full year in short order. That's an anniversary that shouldn't have to exist.</p><p></p><p>I still stay up on news about the war everyday, and I tuck away notes that I always plan to get posted, but just can't find the time for. Hopefully, with a couple days off from work in the coming weeks, I'll be able to get re-caught up on all the stuff I've meant to post (assuming it's still relevant -- things change pretty quickly).</p><p></p><p>One of the blog authors I follow has recently taken to posting a summary of events, which is really pretty decent; I'll post today's version below. It's largely taken from The Guardian's website, with a few extra items that the author finds somewhere. It recaps things reasonably well. Most of the person's posts are actually just maps and really long Twitter threads from the Institute for the Study of War. Those guys put out detailed analyses of all the military interactions and have things broken down by region and sub-region -- Eastern Ukraine: (Eastern Kharkiv Oblast-Western Luhansk Oblast); Russian Subordinate Main Effort—Donetsk Oblast; Supporting Effort—Southern Axis; etc. I won't subject you to that, and usually I skim that stuff anyway. There generally aren't big changes day to day, and winter is putting an added damper on most of the fighting (except for the missiles).</p><p></p><p>In any case, here's one of those summaries; I've added links where possible, but I'm not vouching for any of the sourcing. The bulk of the list can be seen at The Guardian (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-298-of-the-invasion" target="_blank">Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 298 of the invasion</a>); below are the items I didn't see there. (There are duplicates, and given the British spelling, I suspect that some of the items came from previous versions of The Guardian's list.)</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Power has been restored to nearly 6 million Ukrainians in the last 24 hours following a slew of Russian missile strikes against the country’s various infrastructure including its electricity generating systems.</strong> “Repair work continues without a break after yesterday’s terrorist attack,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address on Saturday.</li><li><strong>Russia has claimed that the mass strikes it launched on Friday against Ukraine which led to national power and water outages were part of its prevention of foreign weapons’ delivery to Ukraine.</strong> On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons,” Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing.</li><li><strong>The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has announced that 75% of households in Kyiv had had their heat restored.</strong> In <a href="https://t.me/vitaliy_klitschko/1694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Telegram post</a> on Saturday, Klitschko wrote, “75% of the capital’s residents already have heat supply. Heating engineers continue working for the second day in order to stabilize the situation with heat supply in Kyiv.”</li><li><strong>Russia has denounced a decision by Moldova to temporarily ban six television channels as “political censorship”.</strong> Moldova accused the channels of airing “incorrect information” about the country and Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. The channels are closely tied to the politician and businessman Ilan Shor, who fled the country in 2019 after the election of the pro-western president, Maia Sandu.</li><li><strong>Rescuers have recovered the body of a one-and-a-half-year-old boy from the rubble of Friday’s Russian strike on a three-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region, the region’s governor,

foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, calling the bombings “barbaric”.</li><li><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia still had enough missiles for several more massive strikes and he again urged western allies to supply Kyiv with more and better air defence systems.</strong> “Whatever the rocket worshippers from Moscow are counting on, it still won’t change the balance of power in this war,” he said in Friday’s evening address.</li><li><strong>Air raid sirens were reported across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, on Saturday.</strong> “Please go to the
