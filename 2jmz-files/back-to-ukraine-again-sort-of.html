It was so long ago, and yet, it doesn't seem like it has been that long at all. Time just goes by way to fast.  But here we are, six months since my last trip, and I think I should see my wife again.  I think a husband should see his wife every six months or so.  I guess I'm just old fashioned that way...</p><p>With the exception of my cave-located followers, you know that there is significant unrest going on in Ukraine right now.  Unfortunately, the part of the country where this is happening is also the part of the country I would need to go through.  And for the past couple months I've been getting regular advisory messages from the State Department that strongly urge US citizens to defer travel to Ukraine, particularly to the eastern portion of the country.</p><p>I had started planning my trip and purchasing my travel just as things were starting to boil over in Kiev.  It was before Russia violated international treaties by sending troops into Crimea (and then lying about it for weeks) or so-called "citizen activists" stormed their first city hall.  At the time I believe that things would return to a point of stasis and I could enjoy time with my wife in her country.  Ah, I was so young and foolish then.</p><p>So after much discussion, my wife and I decided to meet in Kiev and then go on to a much safer location:  the Middle East.  OK, I'm being a little flippant; we're actually going to the Persian Gulf -- which is probably still safer than Donetsk.</p><p>Actually, it will be completely safe.  We will be visiting that metropolitan jewel of the Arabian peninsula, Dubai.  Technically I'll be in Ukraine for two days -- on day at the start and end of my travels -- but the bulk of the time will be in Dubai.</p><p>This will be my first time there, and while it has never been on my list of places to see, I'm still trying to get a bit jazzed about it.  Of course, I am definitely jazzed about seeing and being with my wife again.  In some ways, this will be our honeymoon.  (Again, not the place I would have picked for it, but...)</p><p>So this trip will probably have far fewer pictures of Ukraine, and many more of the good ol' United Arab Emirates.  Well, one of the Emirates.  Well, actually, one city in one of the Emirates.  Oh, you know what I mean.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2014/">Ukraine 2014</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/pictures-2.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Pictures!</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/well-of-course.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Well, of course... </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2016-05-24T14:38" class="feed__date">May 24, 2016</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/going-back.html">Going back</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2015-02-14T11:13" class="feed__date">February 14, 2015</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/no-peace-for-ukraine.html">No peace for Ukraine</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2012-09-29T08:46" class="feed__date">September 29, 2012</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/ukraine-on-20-words-a-day-2.html">Ukraine on 20 Words a Day</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
