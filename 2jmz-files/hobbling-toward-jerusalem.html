A brief trip down to Maidan and then by Metro over to the main Kiev train station was about all I could handle. After that I hobbled back to the apartment for a bit of rest and stretching exercises, both of which seemed to help quite a bit.</p><p>I've seen a big train station in person before (London), and this one in Kiev is very much in line with that. Think of New York's Grand Central Station, only a bit smaller and with more people; that's Kiev. There was some of that great old classic train architecture in the main building, and then some nice modern stuff in the auxiliary.</p><p>Although most of the train station was surrounded by industrial type structures, oddly out of place across from the newer building was a church. It looked newer that most of the other ones I've been seeing, at least from the outside; inside it had the same ornate and highly decorated interior as the others.</p><p>Despite the short day, it ended on a rather nice note. As most readers probably know, my company has a working relationship with some Ukrainian developers, and it is only natural to get to know some of your work counterparts on the other side of the world. I have been Skyping with one of these guys for a while, and since he lives in Kiev, we made arrangements to get together this evening. I'm always a little hesitant about such things, but Vladimir turned out to be a very nice and very funny guy. It was a great evening. I had a nice Ukrainian beer (my first ever, because I'm just not a big alcohol consumer), we talked for a couple hours, and then he even helped me get a taxi so I wouldn't have to walk twenty minutes in the rain. I've had some very nice evenings during my trips to Ukraine, and this one definitely ranks high on the list.</p><p>Tomorrow is my last full day in Kiev, and the plan is to visit the Great Patriotic War Monument and Museum. I've taken a couple pictures of the monument already, because it is huge and visible from multiple places in Kiev. Tomorrow I should be able to get an up close look.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2013/">Ukraine 2013</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/its-not-the-heat-its-the-humidity-and-the-heat.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> It&#x27;s not the heat, it&#x27;s the humidity.
