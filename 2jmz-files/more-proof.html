Although there is no active military engagements, there are still things happening in and around the city.  I read a report yesterday that the Russians/rebels (at this point there's hardly a difference) were using the lull to reposition artillery and fortify positions.  Apparently such activities are excluded by the truce and cease-fire.</p><p>In Mariupol, there was some unusual but ultimately non-disruptive activity surrounding the president's visit.  Poroschenko promised some additional personnel and hardware to defend the city, but I have not read if that has arrived or been deployed yet.  The most tell development is kind of a "curfew" and cordon around the city from 10pm to 6am each night.  It is to keep saboteurs from entering the city, but having been to Mariupol, I'm wary of its effectiveness.  People will need to provide proof of residence to enter the city during the curfew hours, and I presume that patrols on the street might be on the look out for "suspicious" people during that time.</p><p>My wife says they are doing OK, but "waiting every day for the shelling."  It seems most people in Mariupol are sure that the fighting around their city is not yet over, and given history and what I've been reading, they are probably right.  I really hope that won't be the case, but it is not a strong hope, I have to say.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2014/">Ukraine 2014</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/we-are-alive.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> &quot;We are alive&quot;</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/maybe-christmas.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Maybe Christmas...? </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
