The Russians don't appear to even be trying at this point. Today, they made the ridiculous offer of safe passage to Russia. While this might have been acceptable to a handful of people in Mariupol (there's always a minority for any position), the proposed route was a non-starter, not in a small part because it went through "hot" parts of the conflict zone. (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-07-intl/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>) <strong>[Edit - Sorry, I want to point out that it's not completely clear that a Mariupol evacuation would have been to Russia.]</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Additionally, ICRC members leaving Mariupol yesterday on the previously agreed upon humanitarian corridor -- the one that couldn't be used for a second day because of Russian shelling after agreeing to a cease-fire -- discovered that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/evacuation-route-offered-to-fleeing-ukrainians-was-mined-e2-80-94red-cross/ar-AAUJot9?ocid=uxbndlbing" target="_blank">the route was mined</a>. It staggers the mind that people could be this duplicitous and evil.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I know that it's very common to cast an enemy as non-human; if something is not "one of us," it's emotionally easier to destroy. I'm seeing this more and more in the news articles and opinion pieces on the Mariupol city website. I'm not in favor of such dehumanizing language because it's a slippery slope. But how do you reason with the unreasonable? How can you appeal to a person's morality when they appear to have none?</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's easy to understand where Viktoria is coming from, and I don't expect that I'll every fully buy into her Slavic fatalism. But it would seem that the odds are against the people of Mariupol.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2022/">Ukraine 2022</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/images-from-the-news.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Images from the news</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/there-are-no-words.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> There are no words </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
