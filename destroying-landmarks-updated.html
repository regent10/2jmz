Every large-ish city has one (so far as I know), and they are usually pretty spectacular, at least from the outside. (I've never been in one; though I have attended a musical in Kyiv, I don't think it was at their "official" drama theater.) Here's a old photo I have of the Mariupol opera house:</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/city_0040.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/city_0040-xs.jpg 300w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/city_0040-sm.jpg 480w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/city_0040-md.jpg 768w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/city_0040-lg.jpg 1024w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/city_0040-xl.jpg 1360w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/city_0040-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt=""><figcaption>Even on a gray day, it was a pretty impressive building.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>So of course <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.0629.com.ua/news/3351731/u-mariupoli-okupanti-skinuli-na-dramteatr-nadpotuznu-bombu-taruta-foto" target="_blank">the Russians decided to drop a bomb on it</a>. This was a gathering and shelter point for citizens during the war. The basement was being used as a bomb shelter, and apparently the rubble of the build blocked that off. I haven't read that it's been unblocked or how many people might have been down there. (<a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3431621-invaders-destroy-theater-in-mariupol-used-as-bomb-shelter-for-hundreds-of-people-city-council.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's another story on it</a>, but no more information.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The drama theater was the heart of downtown and the main public square for the city. The yearly holiday tree and display was there. In the winter, there was a public ice skating ring, built around a fountain that, in the summer, had light and music displays. The area around is like a big park, with trees and walkways and benches. Concessions and kids rides were set up there for most of the year. (It's where I got yelled at by an old man asking for a handout. I didn't understand what he was saying, but he was loud and agitated.)</p><p></p><p></p><p>The other notable location destroyed yesterday was a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3431686-russian-terrorists-bomb-sports-center-in-mariupol.html" target="_blank">public swimming pool and sports complex</a>. I hadn't visited it, but I knew about it; I may have been by it, but I'm not sure. (There's also a newer arena in Mariupol that I have been to.) As a larger, public building, it too was being used for as a bomb shelter. I haven't seen any numbers about casualties.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The attack on these two places had no military value, these were just important places to the people of Mariupol. Russia is trying to wipe Mariupol off the map, destroying not only the people but their spirit as well.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I know that logical consistency is not a strong point for right-wing authoritarians, but if Putin truly believes that there is no such thing as "Ukraine" -- and by extension, Ukrainians -- then he is killing Russians. What sort of leader murders his own people? Tyrants and despots and pathetic, weak men.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><p>CNN has the story too, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-16-22/h_9d4449ebef4774f0f977cd5aff1174c4" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-16-22/h_057c26d24baf4812cbbc8e072d2f2187" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-16-22/h_b7ac8601da74ad3d21cec04bc5c81471" target="_blank">One more.</a></p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><p>Wow, even more evil than you could imagine. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-16-22/h_75b43a36fcc17a0b4398c03f59795b6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The city had indicated that the drama theater had children inside by writing the word "children" -- visible by satellite -- at the front and back of the building.</a></p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1.jpg" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1-xs.jpg 300w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1-sm.jpg 480w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1-md.jpg 768w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1-lg.jpg 1024w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1-xl.jpg 1360w, https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/170/responsive/7cbc3aaa-b222-45bc-9472-49618c5f16c1-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt=""><figcaption>Image taken Monday, with the word "children" ("дети") visible.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2022/">Ukraine 2022</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/just-hell.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Just Hell</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/not-enough-news.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Not enough news </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-03-12T17:12" class="feed__date">March 12, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/really-hard-day-updated.html">Really hard day (Updated)</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-03-10T08:16" class="feed__date">March 10, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/nothing-new-updated.html">Nothing new (Updated)</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
