Currently they are staying with the daughter-in-law (Anya) of V's friend Tanya. Katya is working with the refugee center in the city to get less-crowded housing, and we're working from this side on getting her application for a travel visa to Canada. In case you were wondering, Katya and Zhenya were able to find a nice home in Khmelnitsky for their cat.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Artem:</strong> No definitive word. There may have been a sighting of Artem's stepfather on April 5 in their neighborhood, which may indicate that they family is in their house. It's hard to know for certain; the information came from someone on one of the channels V's been following, who had gotten the information from his daughter. Given the spotty nature of communication with Mariupol and the "friend-of-a-friend" natures of some of these Viber channels, this news is potentially suggestive but not much more.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Baba Katya &amp; Rodion:</strong> Even less here. There's been no direct communication or any message from people who might have seen them. If they were in a rural area outside of Mariupol, that could be part of the reason, but we don't have any confirmation one way or another. Katya 2 did tell V that she had a couple notices on her phone that might have indicated Baba Katya trying to reach her, but that's also non-definitive. (B. Katya calling Katya 2 doesn't make a lot of sense, unless maybe BK was trying to see if K2 was able to get out of Mariupol. I'll have to double-check, but I think that B. Katya had left the bunker before K2 and Vanya did.)</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Inna:</strong> There's been absolutely no word about V's sister. Unless Inna makes contact, this might be a situation where we will never know definitively. She wasn't in the apartment block bunker consistently, and movement around Mariupol is/was dangerous. It's entirely possible that Inna would have been caught up in one of the forced relocation sweeps or that she willingly went with occupation forces because of the need for food and water. So, she might be living somewhere in Russia, which would probably be the best outcome that could be hoped for at the moment. But there's been no word from anywhere one way or another, so we don't know and can only speculate.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Zhenya:</strong> No changes for him since the start of all this. Still on a farm not far from Khmelnitsky. He helps with chores ("watching the chickens"), so likely bored but safe. I saw a post yesterday that the spring military draft was being canceled because the Ukrainian forces had enough people (just, it seems, no sufficient equipment), which would definitely ease one of Viktoria's concerns.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p></footer></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
