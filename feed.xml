                    The weekend saw a pretty awesome event from Ukraine in the Russian war against them: they were able to significantly damage a major symbol of Russia's aggression, the Kerch Bridge. This bridge was built after Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the start of their land grab and illegal war with Ukraine. After taking Crimea, they put&hellip;

                    As I've noted in a couple other places in the past, there really haven't been any significant changes to the status of family and friends. I doubt there will be much changing until the war is largely over, especially in the places we've been watching the most -- Mariupol, Volnovakha, Kherson and other areas with people we know or have&hellip;

                    To utterly no one's surprise, Russia is claiming overwhelming support for the referendums they held in those parts of Ukraine occupied by their armed forces (Ukraine war: Russia claims win in occupied Ukraine 'sham' referendums - BBC). 97 and 98 percent support! Because that's how popular the idea of subjugation by Russia really is. - in "DPR" "for" - 97.91%&hellip;

                    Actually, it's been a little more than 200 days now, but still, 6 months of fighting (on top of the previous 8 years of a "frozen" conflict). Oddly, to my mind, "6 months" sounds longer than "200 days," but it doesn't matter. It's still a long time, and there's been a lot of suffering, damage and death during that time.

                    Continuing with the assorted postings I've collected over the past month-ish... August 17 - I'd mentioned the program proposed by the occupiers to appropriate cars from people unless they [a] still happened to be in the city, and [b] were willing to jump through assorted hoops to try to keep their property. Said proposal is now the law, because you&hellip;

                    Sorry for the lack of updates. After getting away for a few days (something that Viktoria really needed), we both had post-vacation summer colds. Despite all that, I was keeping track of things while we were away and/or sick, so I'm just going to dump a lot of those little notes here. Lots of these things are posts from the&hellip;

                    I had been working on a different post, but now that will have to wait a bit, and unfortunately, some of the information in it has now changed. Sadly, we got word today that V's sister Inna was killed during the shelling of Mariupol. Apparently, this happened at the end of March, but given the "fog of war," the information&hellip;

                    I don't claim to be a particularly religious person, but I try to have a healthy respect for any religious institutions or people that truly seem to serve a greater good. That's part of the reason that I've found the shelling of religious buildings during the war particularly egregious. The multiple rocket GRAD ("Hail") systems are wildly imprecise, so using&hellip;
