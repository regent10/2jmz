                    It was probably a coincidence, but two sources I follow had new postings in the past couple days about the mass graves in and around Mariupol. I know it's not a fun topic to dwell on, but it's something that comes up (in some form or another) fairly frequently in our house. The first thing is this post from one&hellip;

                    There is always a lot going on in Ukraine, and while I tend to read a lot of it, not a whole lot filters down to this blog. I've mentioned it before: I'm mostly focused on the people of Mariupol and places I've visited and know (to some degree). Unfortunately, it remains under Russian occupation, and since Mariupol is one&hellip;

                    The weekend saw a pretty awesome event from Ukraine in the Russian war against them: they were able to significantly damage a major symbol of Russia's aggression, the Kerch Bridge. This bridge was built after Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the start of their land grab and illegal war with Ukraine. After taking Crimea, they put&hellip;

                    As I've noted in a couple other places in the past, there really haven't been any significant changes to the status of family and friends. I doubt there will be much changing until the war is largely over, especially in the places we've been watching the most -- Mariupol, Volnovakha, Kherson and other areas with people we know or have&hellip;

                    To utterly no one's surprise, Russia is claiming overwhelming support for the referendums they held in those parts of Ukraine occupied by their armed forces (Ukraine war: Russia claims win in occupied Ukraine 'sham' referendums - BBC). 97 and 98 percent support! Because that's how popular the idea of subjugation by Russia really is. - in "DPR" "for" - 97.91%&hellip;

                    Actually, it's been a little more than 200 days now, but still, 6 months of fighting (on top of the previous 8 years of a "frozen" conflict). Oddly, to my mind, "6 months" sounds longer than "200 days," but it doesn't matter. It's still a long time, and there's been a lot of suffering, damage and death during that time.

August 17 - I'd mentioned the program proposed by the occupiers to appropriate cars from people unless they [a] still happened to be in the city, and [b] were willing to jump through assorted hoops to try to keep their property. Said proposal is now the law, because you&hellip;

                    Sorry for the lack of updates. After getting away for a few days (something that Viktoria really needed), we both had post-vacation summer colds. Despite all that, I was keeping track of things while we were away and/or sick, so I'm just going to dump a lot of those little notes here. Lots of these things are posts from the&hellip;
