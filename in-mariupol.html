[I]n supermarkets are empty shelves, with the only products being ketchup and cream powder. ... Maybe I was not lucky that I was not born in the country, but I'm close to my family in this difficult time and may be able to do something to help them. ... I did not think of this before, that it could be so difficult and scary to live. ... I feel your warmth around and it gives me a little strength to survive..."</p><p>The vast majority of the people in Mariupol have only wanted a peaceful city and a united Ukraine.  Even when the rebels were occupying some of the buildings and causing all sorts of strife, rallies for peace greatly outnumbered anything the DNR was able to scrape up.  Even this past week, a rally (or two) for Mariupol solidarity drew several thousand people.  But clearly peace is not part of Putin's plan, so "dangerous" Mariupol will be made to suffer.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="./tags/ukraine-2014/">Ukraine 2014</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./picture-time-part-five-the-final-chapter.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Picture time!
