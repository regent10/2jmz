It's true. Granted, Ukrainians being who they are, they call their Westminster Abbey something different and keep it in kiev instead of London. But honestly, Holy Assumption Kyivstar-Pechersk Lavra, is pretty much the same thing. If Ukraine had royal weddings they would probably be there.</p><p>The Lavra is an old, <em>old</em> church and monastery that has been built up over the years, and has served assorted purposes. In fact, in addition to the main cathedral (Uspensky Cathedral - there must have been a promotion over the years), I counted at least four other churches or chapels. There is also an old hospital, school and library, as well as a couple museums and park-like areas. The school and library are still used, the former for an arts academy (I walked through a garden with assorted sculpture and saw some students working on a dance routine) and the latter is the Ukrainian National Museum of Books. There is a walking tour of their catacombs, which date back to 1051, but that closes at 4 pm. (Eh, maybe tomorrow...)</p><p>In the Lavra is also what appears to be a permanent exhibition of micro-miniatures. That was actually pretty impressive. This guy (Siadristy - I had to look that up) back in the late 50s and early 60s was doing painting and sculpture on a very, very small scale. Think chess set on the head of a pin, or a rose sculpted inside a hollowed out human hair -- that scale. 10 UAH (a buck and a quarter) well spent. I also ran into a couple Americans there; a couple guys from California and Hawaii doing the tourist thing. So the West Coast is well represented in Kiev this week.</p><p>In addition to the Lavra, I also dropped by a couple monuments in one of the city parks. There was also some time spent in Maidan Square, watching some of the Kiev Day events. And there were a couple ride on both their Metro (subway) system and the Kiev funicular. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev_Funicular">Here's where you can read all about this little cable car with the funny name.</a>) The ointmental fly for today was the intense rainstorm that blew through late in the afternoon... and of course I didn't have my umbrella with me. I will definitely have it tomorrow; the forecast shows a 90% chance of precipitation.</p><p>But to end on a high note, the rain ended early so Kiev was still able to shoot off their fireworks. I didn't have a great view hanging out the apartment window, but the piece I saw was still very nice.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2013/">Ukraine 2013</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/the-best-laid-plans.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The best laid plans</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/kiev-day-2.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Kiev, Day 2 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2013-05-27T03:53" class="feed__date">May 27, 2013</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/kiev-day-2.html">Kiev, Day 2</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
