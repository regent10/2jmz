I suppose that happens in all wars -- the "sacking of Rome" and whatnot -- but to see it in near real-time and while fighting is still going on has been particularly galling. When Russian soldiers retreated from the northern parts of Ukraine, they took whatever they could carry -- jewelry, food, household goods and appliances -- even toilets and women's clothing. Shortly thereafter, images and videos began appearing of Russians sending their loot back home via courier services in Belarus and elsewhere: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/06/new-footage-shows-russian-troops-sending-stolen-ukrainian-items-home-through-belarus" target="_blank">New footage shows Russian troops sending stolen Ukrainian items home through Belarus - Meduza</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/05/26/russian-soldiers-send-home-58-tons-of-looted-items-from-ukraine-investigation-a77811" target="_blank">Russian Soldiers Send Home 58 Tons of Looted Items from Ukraine — Investigation - The Moscow Times</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Although the Russians essentially reduced Mariupol to rubble before they took command of what was left, they've managed to add insult to injury by continuing to steal whatever was still of some value and wasn't nailed down -- although they've even "un-nailed" some stuff.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>Claiming that you're doing it to "keep it safe" doesn't mean you're not stealing: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/07/06/how-russia-removed-priceless-kuindzhi-artworks-from-ukraines-mariupol-a77765" target="_blank">How Russia 'Removed' Priceless Kuindzhi Artworks from Ukraine's Mariupol - The Moscow Times</a>; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newsweek.com/putins-military-stole-famous-artwork-ukraine-museum-mariupol-council-1722614" target="_blank">Putin's Military Stole Famous Artwork From Ukraine Museum: Mariupol Council - Newsweek</a></li><li>I'd actually seen something about this plan well over a month ago. The occupying forces basically said, "come move your car or we'll have it towed" to the citizens of Mariupol (wherever they might be). People had until the end of June to reclaim their property, after which it would be taken to Donetsk and sold. As if people who had fled the city or country would be allowed back in to reclaim personal property.

Most of it has been stolen from and shipped out of places other than Mariupol, but Mariupol did have a new grain terminal and capabilities in place prior to the war. Upon taking Mariupol, one of the first things the Russians did was de-mine the port and ship out grain from the surrounding area: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/423757-turkish-ship-leaves-ukraines-mariupol-after-grain-talks-with-moscow" target="_blank">Turkish ship leaves Ukraine's Mariupol after grain talks with Moscow - GeoNews</a>.

I remember writing out one of the hospitals where the personnel were forced onto a bus and taken out of the city; a lot of them ended up in Donetsk. There were almost no doctors left in Mariupol.</li><li>Occupiers have also dismantled and taken to Donetsk the fountain that was next to the bombed theater in central Mariupol. Apparently the Nazis did the same thing in WWII. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.espreso.tv/like-fascists-russian-military-steal-fountain-from-mariupol-city-council" target="_blank">"Like fascists": Russian military steal fountain from Mariupol - city council - Espreso</a></li><li>It's part of the "fountain work," but they're also stealing the paving stones from the park. It's hard to imagine anything more petty. Oh, that's right, they've also stolen playground equipment. <a href="https://twitter.com/ZMiST_Ua/status/1544260787539128320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/ZMiST_Ua/status/1544260787539128320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a></li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>(In one of my previous trips to Mariupol, I'd noted and taken pictures of some of the neat pavers that were everywhere in the city. It was just how the sidewalks were made in some places. Here's a sample from before the war, and even before the big city renaissance of the previous two years. That's what the Russians are stealing.)</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-136"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/224/stone_0012-1024x768.jpg" alt="Stone 1" sizes="100vw" srcset="./media/posts/224/responsive/stone_0012-1024x768-xs.jpg 300w, ./media/posts/224/responsive/stone_0012-1024x768-sm.jpg 480w, ./media/posts/224/responsive/stone_0012-1024x768-md.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/224/responsive/stone_0012-1024x768-lg.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/224/responsive/stone_0012-1024x768-xl.jpg 1360w, ./media/posts/224/responsive/stone_0012-1024x768-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><figcaption>Just walking around the city, you'll often find yourself on some nice stone sidewalks. And we're talking some nice stonework (which is a nice break from the far more common asphalt). I had noticed this last year and started to take some photos of the different stone patters, and it had been my plan to continue it this year, but I often forgot. Still, I did get a few shots, such as this rather intricate, two-tone pattern that features signs of the zodiac.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><p>And what do the Russians give the people of Mariupol for all the stuff that's been stolen...? <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3525461-russian-humanitarian-aid-to-mariupol-moldy-stale-bread-shovels.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian “humanitarian aid” to Mariupol: moldy stale bread, shovels - Ukrinform</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 5, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="./tags/ukraine-2022/">Ukraine 2022</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./a-sign.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> A sign?</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./no-good-reason.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> No good reason </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-17T09:51" class="feed__date">April 17, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./mariupol-video-plus.html">Mariupol video, plus</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-16T10:11" class="feed__date">April 16, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./mariupol.html">Mariupol</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-04-08T11:47" class="feed__date">April 8, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./mariupol-and-beyond.html">Mariupol and beyond</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
