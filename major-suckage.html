My connection in Amsterdam was tight -- 50 minutes. The travel engines have given me this connection in the past, but having been through Amsterdam airport, I was wary. I even sent an email to Delta asking if fifty minutes was really enough time, and they said, sure, that's the minimum they need.</p><p>So I booked the flight with the fifty minute connection. Bad, bad idea.</p><p>The flight out of Portland got off late and got into Amsterdam even later -- 20 minutes late. After taxiing forever, I got off my 8:30 arrival at 9:00. And -- of course -- my connection was on the other side of the airport.</p><p>After rushing across the airport and going through the security screening again, I arrived at the departure gate 5 minutes after they closed the doors. So, yeah.</p><p>I've gotten rebooked on the next flight to Kiev, but that's not until 8:00 pm tonight; it will get into Kiev just after midnight (local time).</p><p>I've sent texts to my wife which hopefully made sense. I also sent a message to my developer friend in Kiev -- which I hope that he will see -- asking him to call my wife and explain things. But now I'm just stuck here for the next 9 hours.</p><p>As I said, major suckage...</p><p><strong>Quick update:</strong>  I got online again -- lucky for me I have both a laptop and tablet with me on this trip, because Schipol limits your wifi connections -- and was able to see a message from my friend.  He got in touch with my wife, so I can sure that she knows what is going on.  (We communicate OK, but sometimes you want to be extra sure.)  My flight is just a couple hours away, so I will get to Kiev, but I really hate that I've lost a full day with my wife.</p><p>If any Delta people read this blog, I hope that you feel really, really bad.  (And I haven't even mentioned the issue with the flight from Portland, other than its late departure.  So far, this has not been a great start to my vacation...)</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2014/">Ukraine 2014</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/and-hes-off.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> And he&#x27;s off</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/dubai-day-2.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Dubai, Day 2 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
