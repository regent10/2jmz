this is an error in the very first lesson!)</p><p>I don't have a lot on tap for Friday.  I leave early, early Saturday morning, so I need to prepare for that.  And I know there's at least one more picture I want to get.  There's a  place downtown with a beautiful new building on one side of the street, and an old, graffitied (yet still lived in) building on the other.  It's a great contrast of Old and New Mariupol.  I really hope my camera can get both sides of the street at the same time.  And I have been told there is one more Ukrainian food I have to try before I leave (although after tonight's very filling traditional Ukrainian dinner, I don't want to think about food at all).  It's a half-round pastry filled with meat, fried and served with sour cream called "chayooriki."  (I probably didn't need to add "served with sour cream," because everything is.  Except for a couple types of salad.)</p><p>By the way, if I haven't mentioned it, Saturday is going to be a bear of a travel day.  I leave here at 6 am local time (which means I need to be up by 5:30 at the latest).  I'll have about a 90 minute (or so) ride to Donetsk, about an hour wait at the airport, and then an hour-long flight to Kiev.  (I'm crossing my fingers that I don't have a delay like in Odessa; that would screw me over royally.)  I'm in Kiev for a couple hours, and then it's my 10-hour flight to JFK.  I'm in New York for 2-3 hours, and then it's 5 more hours back to Portland.  Technically I get in at midnight of the same day I left Mariupol, but with baggage and the drive from the airport, it will be 1 am before I'm back "home."  To recap, that's 16 hours on planes, 6 hours in airports and 3 hours in cars -- all on the same day.  25 hours of travel, but that's still better than the 38 hours it took me to get to Odessa.</p><p>(PS - Actually, because of my JFK delay - and a little original miscalculation of times - I will get home about 32 hours after my alarm clock went off on Saturday morning in Mariupol.  I thought I'd be able to sleep a little on the plane from Ukraine, but I was very wrong.  Right now, I've been up for 20 hours, with only a little dozing time to the sleep account.)</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2011/">Ukraine 2011</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/mariupol-3.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Mariupol 3</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/a-light-at-the-end.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> A light at the end </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2014-09-03T08:00" class="feed__date">September 3, 2014</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/word-from-mariupol.html">Word from Mariupol</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2014-08-31T11:00" class="feed__date">August 31, 2014</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/in-mariupol.html">In Mariupol</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2012-09-23T08:56" class="feed__date">September 23, 2012</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/mariupol-cemetery-2.html">Mariupol Cemetery</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
