He stated outright that nothing was going to be accomplished at the summit he and Ukraine had today in Turkey. Of course, he stated it after the fact, just so everyone could waste their time for no purpose. And he again repeated the Russian position that they'd targeted the maternity hospital deliberately because it was <em>really</em> a Ukrainian army post. Sure, he too saw the images taken directly after the attack of the bloodied women and doctors, but who are you going to believe -- him, or your lying eyes?</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Update: </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3425923-russias-defense-ministry-diplomacy-fail-to-speak-in-one-voice-when-lying-about-bombing-mariupol-maternity-hospital.html" target="_blank">It seems the Russians are having trouble keeping their stories straight.</a> Apparently, they are responsible for it, because they were acting on superior intelligence against those evil and cunning Ukrainians who would use a hospital as cover, but they also want the world to know that it was all a staged event by the Ukrainians, who attacked their own hospital and patients to make the Russians look bad.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Also, Viktoria got word that her sister has shown up at the apartment block.
