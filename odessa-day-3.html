(I did still find some corner markets that had "supermarket" on their signs, so clearly the term is still up to some interpretation.)</p><p>I came across two galleria-type malls yesterday, and both of them had a supermarket for their basement floors.  (Probably the same chain, but I didn't verify that.) They are mini "all-in-one" type stores, kind of like a small Fred Meyer, or a Safeway with a few extra items. It was great fun exploring and seeing the differences. I picked up a small box of breakfast cereal call "Start!" - that's the actual English name on the box, but oddly that's the only English on it, even though the contents are listed in 9 different languages. In the tradition of Tony the Tiger, there was a cartoon lion on the box and the contents were indeed frosted flakes...</p><p>My afternoon outing took me to the Potemkin Stairs, and it is easily a bigger draw than Deribasovskaya street.  (Rather expected; even though I haven't seen the movie that made the steps famous, I knew the name.)  Definitely an interesting place for just being a staircase.  You can get your photo taken on it for 5 hrivnya (about 60 cents), or if you like more exotic fare, you can go half-way down and get your photo taken with an eagle, a falcon, or a monkey. (I didn't see the price of that, though.)  And across from the steps, on a pier stretching into the Black Sea, is the very impressive looking Hotel Odessa.  I remember seeing this listing when I was making my travel plans, and if I come back here in the future, I might have to stay there for at least one night.</p><p>Two final notes for the day.  One, today wasn't quite as hot as expected (still plenty humid), and there was even a brief shower as I was heading back to the apartment.  Of course, this was also the day I had done a load of laundry and hung it out on the balcony to dry, so the weather was both a little good and bad.  And two, apparently I do look "a little" American.  While it's true I never felt I was fooling anyone, it was a little funny to be told that right out.</p><p>And the word for waiter is "officiant."  There's a similar word for a waitress, but I'd have to look it up.</p><p>Oh, and on my way back to the apartment, there was a small orchestra playing in the gazebo at City Park.  I didn't get a picture because I was on the wrong side.  I don't know if they were play because it was this holiday, or if it was just Sunday.  Either way, it was a rather neat way to wrap up the afternoon.</p><p>I need to get to bed a little early tonight, so I can be up at 5 tomorrow morning.  My ride will be here at 5:30 to take me to the airport for the next part of my adventure, Donetsk and Mariupol.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2011/">Ukraine 2011</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/odessa-day-2.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Odessa, Day 2</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/yeah-about-the-pictures.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Yeah, about the pictures </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2011-08-13T16:00" class="feed__date">August 13, 2011</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/odessa-day-2.html">Odessa, Day 2</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2011-08-13T08:59" class="feed__date">August 13, 2011</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/odessa-day-1.html">Odessa, Day 1</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
