As I've commented before, it is huge (about 100 ft. shorter than the Statue of Liberty) and visible for miles around Kiev.</p><p>One thing I kind of wish we had done was to visit the Afghanistan memorial.  In some ways, the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan in the 80s was similar to the US involvement in Vietnam.  I've seen the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., and it is very moving.  I only saw a little of the Afghanistan Memorial (from the door), but it too looked like it could have a lot of impact.  Oh well, maybe next time.  (I'm not a big fan of wars by any means, but I think it is important to recognize the significant losses they cause, so that they might be avoided in the future.)</p><p>Well, not much else to note, I guess.  It was a wide-ranging trip for me; a little more "touristy" than I usually do -- I'm more interested in seeing (and, to some degree, experiencing) how people live in the places I visit -- but still some great experiences.</p><figure class="ngg_displayed_gallery mceItem"><strong>Last Day</strong> <img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/79/id--892" alt=""></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2013/">Ukraine 2013</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/pictures-10-trains.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Pictures 10: Trains</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/the-road-here.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The road here </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2013-06-22T22:07" class="feed__date">June 22, 2013</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/pictures-6-waves-and-rails.html">Pictures 6: Waves &amp; Rails</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2013-06-18T20:56" class="feed__date">June 18, 2013</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/pictures-5-podil.html">Pictures 5: Podil</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2013-06-16T21:34" class="feed__date">June 16, 2013</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/pictures-4-st-andrews-and-st-sophia.html">Pictures 4: St. Andrew&#x27;s &amp; St. Sophia</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
