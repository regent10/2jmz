The fish was very fresh (in some cases, still moving) and the meat/butcher area would probably convince vegetarians they had made the right choice (and maybe pick up a few converted carnivores).  It was really something to see.</p><p>The other time I really wanted my camera was on the bus from the airport into Kiev on my last day. We passed by an office building that had really done a spectacular job on their holiday lights.  It was truly impressive.  Of course, to get that shot I would have have needed to know it was coming up and had my camera at the ready, but I didn't know it was there and didn't have my camera out, so it remains just a fleeting image from a moving bus window.  (Unless I can find a photo online, which I haven't yet been able to.)</p><p>I did take a couple photos of my apartment in Mariupol, but since those look almost exactly the same as the ones at the booking agency site, I thought I'd just point you to those. <a title="My Mariupol home" href="http://www.dobovo.com/mariupol-apartments/119-stroiteley-22745.html">Here you go.</a> It turned out to be a pretty nice place, so if you're ever going to Mariupol, you might consider staying there.</p><p>Now, on to the pictures. The first gallery is the photos taken by the "house photographer" at the wedding hall. We only got 5 prints, but given the photos, I kind of wish we'd gotten the full package. (Viktoria didn't think we needed any, so 5 photos was a compromise; the full package would only have been 100 UAH more -- about $12.)</p><p>The second gallery is of the photos taken by my camera, sometimes with me at the helm, sometimes with others.  There's a little overlap of the wedding images, but it's kind of neat to have the same photo from different angles.</p><figure class="ngg_displayed_gallery mceItem"><strong>Wedding Photographer </strong><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/95/id--992" alt=""></figure><p><strong>My Camera<figure class="ngg_displayed_gallery mceItem"><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/95/id--890" alt=""></figure></strong></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2013/">Ukraine 2013</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/homeward-bound.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Homeward bound</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/back-to-ukraine-again-sort-of.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Back to Ukraine again, sort of </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2011-08-28T13:09" class="feed__date">August 28, 2011</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/pictures.html">Pictures!</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
