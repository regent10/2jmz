The day started off with a trip across the street (literally) to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_Church,_Kiev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Andrew's Church</a>. It's one of the older churches in Kiev, and the namesake of the street where the apartment was. <a title="Kiev, Day 2" href="https://2jmz.com/?p=384">As I mentioned in my comments for the day's post</a>, despite the ornateness of this Baroque era church, this seemed like one of the more "accessible" sites we visited.</p><p>After St. Andrew's, we wandered over toward the city center in order to see the St. Sophia Cathedral complex. I had originally thought that all the street vendors of Saturday and Sunday were more of a weekend and/or Kiev Days thing; nope. They are always there, day in and day out. Some have formal stands or kiosks, but a lot of people just set up a card table, lay out their wares and start selling. This isn't the case everywhere in Kiev, but since this was more of a tourist area, it only made sense. (I can't imagine doing that for a living; some of the days were pretty hot, but people would be out there the entire day, often not packing up until 7 or 8 pm.)</p><p>Honestly, after seeing the Lavra, visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sophia%27s_Cathedral,_Kievhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St. Sophia</a> was a bit superfluous. It was different, still amazing, and not nearly as large as the Lavra complex. I think if we had actually gone into the cathedral it would have been something a bit more special; I've seen some photos and the inside does look amazing. Plus I'm pretty sure I was wearing pants that day. Even so, I don't think cameras were allowed in the cathedral, so even if I'd gone in, I wouldn't have been able to share it. Oh well. (We did visit the House of the Metropolitan, which was interesting enough -- and also required a separate admission.)</p><p>So here are the first batch of photos for the second day. There was a rain storm about halfway through the day, so it was easy to separate things. At least we were closer to the apartment when the rains came this time; on the day before, we had just left the Lavra and were walking along the street when the winds came up and the rain quickly followed. This time we had a little more warning, didn't have as far to go, and I had my umbrella handy.</p><p><strong>St. Andrews and St. SophiaÂ </strong></p><figure class="ngg_displayed_gallery mceItem"><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/72/id--917" alt=""></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p></footer></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
