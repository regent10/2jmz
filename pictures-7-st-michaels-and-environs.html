This day in Kiev -- the 4th or 12th or 182nd, I'm not sure at this point -- was another big picture day, so I've split it into two galleries. First up is a visit to St. Michael's Church, followed by a little bit of wandering around the Maidan Square part of town.</p><p>St. Michael's is probably the third most prominent church in Kiev, tourist-wise, behind the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra and St. Sophia Cathedral. St. Michael's didn't feel quite as much of a tourist location as those others, though; there definitely weren't as many people wandering around when we were there. It is also a school/seminary and there were several art students on the grounds when we were there, so it really had a different feel. If you're in Kiev, want to see a very traditional Ukrainian church and don't feel like fighting the crowds, you should definitely check out St. Michaels. (And it was only about 10 minutes walk from the apartment -- really easy to get to.)</p><p>After that, it was a little stroll through a nearby park, a circle around the <a href="http://mysteriouskiev.com/kiev-sightseing/monuments/monument-to-prince-volodymyr_75303/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monument to Prince Volodymyr</a> (I couldn't remember the name of this when I was writing the photo captions), and then down to Maidan Square. Along the way we happened on to a Polish Catholic church -- not that Polish Catholic is different from Roman Catholic; it just happened to be a Polish speaking parish. (Historically, Poland had a huge influence on Ukraine, including control of some of the territory in the past. There remains a bit of lingering antagonism between the two countries.) This church turned out to be a kind of important church -- Pope John Paul II said Mass there when he visited Ukraine. A Polish pope saying Mass at a Polish parish? -- oh yeah, that's a big deal! (There was a display in the church with the altar used by the pope.) I don't have any photos of the inside -- no picture-taking was allowed -- but some of the interior architecture was interesting, and there was a definite Ukrainian or Slavic influence in the art that adored the sanctuary.</p><p>After some lunch/dinner at the apartment, it was time for "My Fair Lady" at the Operetta Theater; that will be the subject of my next post and set of photos.</p><p><strong>St. Michael's and environs<figure class="ngg_displayed_gallery mceItem"><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/75/id--906" alt=""></figure></strong></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p></footer></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
