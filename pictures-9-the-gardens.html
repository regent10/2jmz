I had to draw the line somewhere.)</p><p>I also got a few pictures of one of the churches there before my camera battery died.  No trouble with the camera; I'd just forgotten to charge it up the night before.  This was the church where I got chided for sitting cross-legged in the vestibule (and no, I'm not going to make any jokes about sitting <em>cross</em>-legged in a <em>church</em>).</p><p>The trip home from the gardens involved riding a trolley bus for the first time.  The trolley buses are electric and get their juice from overhead wires.  The novelty was short-lived because it was, after all, a bus.  But we got off at Arsenal Metro station (so named for a small cannon mounted in front of the building) and took the subway the rest of the way home.  Fortunately, there wasn't anything too interesting about the subway station, or I would have been even more bummed about having a dead camera.</p><p><strong>Gardens<figure class="ngg_displayed_gallery mceItem"><img loading="lazy" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/media/posts/77/id--900" alt=""></figure></strong></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p></footer></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
