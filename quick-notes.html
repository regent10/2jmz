And write.  As always, if you have questions, let me know.  But for the last post of my free day, here are a few small observations.</p><ul><li>I am a terrible husband, because it failed to occur to me that this is our 6-month anniversary.  I blame all the travel and time changes and stuff, because I simply did not know that this was the 29th.  And how is my wife spending the evening?  A long bus ride to and from Abu Dhabi.  Maybe we can do something nice tomorrow.</li><li>The bus shelters are air conditioned.  They kind of have to be, wouldn't they?  Apparently the AC isn't on all day, but if you're out walking and need a little break, look for a bus shelter.  (Even my wife, who complains about being cold if the temperature is below 22.5 C -- about 72 F, has found the shelters to be helpful when we are out walking.)</li><li>I have yet to see any advertised price for gasoline.  There are cars and gas stations everywhere, but I haven't seen any signs listing the price per liter.  It may be that gas is just so cheap that if you can afford to own a car, you won't have any trouble buying gas.  Or maybe it's free.</li><li>I don't think I've seen a fast food establishment that wasn't right next to a gas station.  Perhaps these folks take the "fast" notion a little too strictly.</li><li>In addition to Burger King, McDonald's and Pizza Hut, you will also find Wendy's, Fuddruckers, Hardee's, Dominos and Round Table Pizza here in Dubai.</li><li>Despite the predominance of English speakers, Americans are still something of a rarity, if the reactions I've gotten from people are a true guide.  I hear British and Australian accents around, and I do know that there are some Americans staying in the hotel.  But any time I've been out and someone has asked where I am from, they seem genuinely surprised at the answer.</li><li>Apparently, I have the type of skin that simply cannot be blocked by sunblock.  So if you hear a report of a quiet American man who spontaneously combusted on a beach in Dubai, you'll know that was me.</li></ul></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p></footer></article><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
