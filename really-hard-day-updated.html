This morning she was getting pictures and videos of Mariupol, including some taken very near to Zhenya's apartment. One picture showed damage and burned out cars in the courtyard area of the apartment block; another was from across the main street, toward where her friend Olga lives. These are places near and dear to her, and seeing the destruction was difficult. (These are places I've seen or been to as well.) Then she learned that the pictures were actually from two days ago, and that just made things worse. I mean, if two days ago it was hell and nothing since has improved, what does that make today?</p><p></p><p></p><p>No humanitarian assistance today either. Not only did the convoy get attacked, when it wasn't being attacked, it was being stopped and looted by those doing the attacking. I don't know that there's a depth to the evil and depravity these people can show.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Here are some assorted news articles for the day:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3427961-invaders-plunder-mariupolbound-humanitarian-convoy.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3427961-invaders-plunder-mariupolbound-humanitarian-convoy.html">Invaders plunder Mariupol-bound humanitarian convoy (ukrinform.net)</a> - as I was saying</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3428024-enemy-aircraft-bomb-sviatohirsk-lavra-in-donetsk-region.html" target="_blank">Enemy aircraft bomb Sviatohirsk Lavra in Donetsk region (ukrinform.net)</a> - This is the equivalent of bombing a cathedral, and there were civilians sheltering inside.
