The British have said that there have already been some cases in Mariupol - <a href="https://www.0629.com.ua/news/3404821/v-travni-v-mariupoli-zafiksovani-persi-vipadki-holeri-britanska-rozvidka">In May, the first cases of cholera were recorded in Mariupol, - British intelligence - 0629.com.ua</a> - and apparently the Russians are concerned about a rash of cases too, and they are taking precautions in places that aren't Mariupol - <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3473178-russia-bracing-for-cholera-epidemic-in-regions-bordering-ukraine-intel.html">Russia bracing for “cholera epidemic” in regions bordering Ukraine - intel (ukrinform.net)</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><p>Because of the scope of recovery of the bodies of those killed by their aggression, the Russians and DPR have decided that they just aren't going to bother anymore. There had been some stories and photos initially of workers, including citizens of Mariupol, going through the rubble of destroyed building to recover the dead. (The people of Mariupol were doing this work because it was one of the few ways to get food.) But that was slow going because there are a lot of destroyed buildings and a lot of bodies. So now there are no recovery efforts; they are just scooping up the rubble and carting it off - <a href="https://www.0629.com.ua/news/3404910/v-mariupoli-okupanti-vezut-budivelne-smitta-razom-z-zaliskami-til-na-zacineni-smittezvalisa-foto">In Mariupol, the occupiers carry construction debris along with the remains of bodies to closed landfills - PHOTOS - 0629.com.ua</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While I'm sure part of the argument for doing this is to more quickly address the decomposition and stench that has been enveloping the city, it also give cover to mask the true numbers of the dead and to prevent meaningful closure for a lot of people.

Not that they were necessarily identified.
