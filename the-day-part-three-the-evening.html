I'm honestly not sure what happens over all those days, but maybe that's just my culture bias showing through. American weddings -- all on one incredibly full and usually stressful day; to me, that just makes sense. I guess that in some ways, that's what we had here too.</p><p>After the ceremony -- which, all told (including the sales pitch for photos), was about 45 minutes -- we all walked down the street to a restaurant and took over one of the back corners. Not that we were a big "all" -- it was me and my wife, her son Zhenya, my wife's mother Svetlana, her sister Inna and Inna's toddler Rodion. And Svetlana, our translator, of course. (Well, maybe not "of course;" my wife and I can communicate pretty well, but Svetlana was integral to our courtship and wedding, so why not?)</p><p>We ordered a bottle of wine, assorted other drinks, a couple salads, some breads and some pork and veal "shish kebab." Curiously no pastry item, a la, a wedding cake. But it was pretty nice. I got to learn more about the traditional customs we weren't following, I told them about a "traditional" American wedding (they actually have a hard time understanding that Americans don't all do the same things the same way, but Ukraine is not a country of immigrants either), and really just had a nice time.</p><p>There was a little business as well. Since Svetlana the translator was there not just as a witness to the wedding, but also in her professional capacity, she helped my wife fill out her piece of the immigration paperwork I'll need to do when I return. If I'd thought that my wife was stressed out about the wedding, that almost paled in comparison to her concern about filling out a simple biographic form. Granted, we are talking wholly different alphabets here, and that was a bit of the problem (for example, that backwards Russian R could be translated as "a," "ia," or "ya"), but still, I think she was waaaay more worried about making a mistake than she needed to be. But she got it all filled out, and then we all had a pretty nice time. I think we were there about 4 hours, which seemed about right for that sort of wedding reception. (I told my wife we'd probably have a couple more ceremonies and/or receptions when she gets to the US.)</p><p>So that was the wedding. Even with three posts, I've probably left out a bit. And of course there are pictures, but it looks like those will again need to wait until I'm back home. (If I'd planned a little better, I could have bought and brought a little attachment that would let me copy the camera photos to my iPad. And sadly I haven't been able to find one at the Apple or computer stores here. C'est la vie!)</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="./tags/ukraine-2013/">Ukraine 2013</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./the-day-part-two.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The Day (part two)</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./the-limit.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> The limit </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2014-06-22T07:00" class="feed__date">June 22, 2014</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./picture-time-part-four.html">Picture time!
