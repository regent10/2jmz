However, there has been ongoing fighting since that truce/ceasefire was announced, mostly in and around Donetsk, but many other locations as well.  One reporter in the area tweeted that he hadn't really seen any reduction in the fighting at all.</p><p>This week a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/rebels-make-gains-during-cease-fire/2014/10/01/a3e6346a-4993-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_graphic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">map </a>starting making the rounds showing territory that had been seized by the Russians since the truce/ceasefire was announced.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/rebels-make-gains-during-cease-fire/2014/10/01/a3e6346a-4993-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_graphic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It is astounding.</a>  It seems the only party adhering to the ceasefire is the Ukrainian military; although they will respond when fired upon, being non-assertive has allowed the Russians to just start taking more area.</p><p>Also this past week:</p><ul><li>Russian increased the persecution of the Crimean Tartars -- essentially following the game plan that was used in 1944.  They are also starting to amass troops along the border with mainland Ukraine, and they have enacted additional laws making any form of dissent punishable by deportation.</li><li>Partisan leaders in Donetsk acknowledged -- apparently without permission from Moscow -- that members of the Russian army were assisting them, in "advisory" roles.  This seems to be at odds with statements by partisan fighters this week that put the division of military personnel fighting at the Donetsk airport as 90% Russian, and only 10% Ukrainian.</li><li>A poll of Russian citizens showed over 60% did not want to commit troops to Ukraine, with only 12% saying that troops were already in Ukraine.  This is why the Kremlin continues to conduct very quiet burials of dead service members, and continues to lie to their families. It really pays to have total control of the information flow, doesn't it?</li></ul><p>I don't know what more to say.  Until the world starts paying more attention to this ongoing (and growing ) threat in Ukraine, Russia will continue to run roughshod over international laws and treaties -- all for the grandiose ambitions of that petty Putin, who seems determined to be the next Stalin or Hitler.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="./tags/ukraine-2014/">Ukraine 2014</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./normalcy.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Normalcy</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./a-year.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> A year </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-05-29T08:12" class="feed__date">May 29, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./what-bs.html">What BS!</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
