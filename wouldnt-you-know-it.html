I really don't have all that much to say about Kiev this time; we're in the same part of the city as last time, and honestly, my time in Kiev is really more about paperwork and government stuff than sightseeing. Plus, as it's been cold, windy and wet since I first arrived, I'm not doing pictures either. (Today is quite cold and there are a few snow flurries around.)</p><p>On a very positive note, I was able to get my document work completed yesterday. For a foreigner to get married in Ukraine, it is necessary to get a document that states you are legally able to get married -- a "Letter of Non-Impediment to Marriage." It basically just has my name and information, my fiancee's name and info, and a statement at the bottom that I've never been married and can legally get hitched. (There's a corresponding version for people who have been previously married. But, surprise, no version if you are currently married.) This document has to be stamped by the embassy in Ukraine, and their only office is in Kiev. So yesterday morning, way too bright and early, I headed over to the embassy. (You know, I don't think I've ever said that before.)</p><p>If you ever want, however briefly, to feel like a VIP, go to your embassy in a foreign country. In Ukraine, and I would guess elsewhere, there is a line of natives waiting to get into the embassy on assorted business. For me, being a US citizen, I just had to go to the security booth, present my passport, and I went right to the front of the line. A nice little rush, that. It didn't last long, though; once you're inside, you empty your pockets, go through security, and just become another person in a different line. However, things went along just fine, I got my document stamped, and so endth part one.</p><p>Part two started right away. Just having a (now) official looking document from the US government doesn't mean squat in Ukraine. It was necessary for me to take that document and have it authenticated by the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This was fun, and I'm glad I did my research before I got here. The Ministry building is large and impressive, but it's not where you go for document services. That place is across the street, down an alley and around a turn or two. But like I said, I'd done my research so I knew where to go. Fortunately I also had Viktoria with me for this, because the Ukrainian government conducts business in Ukrainian. If the clerks we dealt with spoke any English, they certainly didn't show it. But we got that paperwork filled out, paid the fee, and a few hours later, I was able to return and pick it up, authenticated and everything. Whew, what load off!</p><p>(If Viktoria hadn't joined me in Kiev, I would have hired a translator to help with that part. Honestly, filling out the form was never of great concern. It was more the uncertainty of dealing with the bureaucracy of a foreign government.)</p><p>A couple things have made my time in Kiev a tad more interesting. First, there's the weather, which as I'd said has been rotten. On top of that, I wasn't able to mind my nifty new vented, collapsible umbrella. I know I had it with all the stuff I had to pack, but I just can't find it. I'm sure it will be sitting on the floor, waiting for me upon my return.</p><p>The other thing falls into the "could this get any worse" category. Just before I left -- and far too late for me to do anything about it -- I got an email from the embassy warning US citizens about demonstrations that would be happening that weekend. The email urged people to avoid downtown Kiev, so just guess where my apartment is. Even so I wasn't too concerned; I figured that things would be pretty well wrapped up by the time I arrived. Nope. Things were actually just kicking off. Fortunately this was all a little ways off, so most of it wasn't a bother. Then I got an email last night. Apparently the demonstrations were so much fun that they've been held over. For the entire week, morning and night. Viktoria and I were out walking and there are police on standby all around the square.</p><p>Other than that, it's been a quiet and productive visit here. I check out shortly and then have an overnight train to Mariupol. That should be an interesting experience.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 4, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/tags/ukraine-2013/">Ukraine 2013</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/authors/james/" rel="author">james</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/the-road-here.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The road here</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/midnight-train.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Midnight train </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2014-09-05T08:42" class="feed__date">September 5, 2014</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/ill-believe-it-when-i-see-it.html">I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it...</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-right">Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://regent10.github.io/2jmz/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
